# student_result_analysis
In this project, I harnessed the power of Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to dissect and represent student performance data.

By employing tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn,the goal was to transform raw data on student results—such as Math score, Reading Score, Writing score—into insightful visualizations. These visualizations take various forms, from bar charts,stacked bars charts to heatmaps, pie chart, and interactive dashboards.
